# Data Modeling & NoSQL Databases

Data Modeling: The process of taking a real world or conceptual idea and encoding it into Javascript's built in data types. Models typically describe the physical characteristics (properties) and behaviors (methods) of an object in a way that you can write code that uses your models to problem solve and create applications.
